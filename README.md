# Recommendation System


## API: TicketMaster

## Throughout this project,  I practiced how to design and implement a recommendation engine operated at scale, by getting my hands dirty on developing an event recommendation and ticket search engine from the ground up. Meanwhile, I deployed a proven set of back-end services and databases and learned how to test and maintain it on AWS.

## Front-end Back-end Fullstack
####  Tools: Java, Spring, Springboot/SpringMVC, Maven, AWS, TomCat, MySQL MongoDB MapReduce REST API Java Servlet OOD Cloud Computing
