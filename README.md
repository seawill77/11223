## Server: AWS / DB: MySQL  / TomCAT / API: TicketMaster  

## Throughout this project,  I practiced how to design and implement a recommendation engine operated at scale, by getting my hands dirty on developing an event recommendation and ticket search engine from the ground up. Meanwhile, I deployed a proven set of back-end services and databases and learned how to test and maintain it on AWS.
